# Plant Monitor
<!--- Replace this text with a brief description (2-3 sentences) of your project. This description should draw the reader in and make them interested in what you've built. You can include what the biggest challenges, takeaways, and triumphs from completing the project were. As you complete your portfolio, remember your audience is less familiar than you are with all that your project entails! -->

<!--- You should comment out all portions of your portfolio that you have not completed yet, as well as any instructions: -->

| **Engineer** | **School** | **Area of Interest** | **Grade** |
|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|
| Sara N. | Los Gatos High School | Astronautical Engineering | Incoming Junior

<!--- **Replace the BlueStamp logo below with an image of yourself and your completed project. Follow the guide [here](https://tomcam.github.io/least-github-pages/adding-images-github-pages-site.html) if you need help.** -->

For your final milestone, explain the outcome of your project. Key details to include are:
- What you've accomplished since your previous milestone
- What your biggest challenges and triumphs were at BSE
- A summary of key topics you learned about
- What you hope to learn in the future after everything you've learned at BSE

&nbsp; My goal is to make a plant monitor that can be controlled by one's phone. To do this, the first main step was to make the Arduino Uno Rev3 board connect to Blynk through WiFi. Blynk is a software that can be used on mobile devices and enables its users to access their devices such as the Arduino thanks to the WiFi connection they share; in this project, Blynk will be used to check and use the plant monitor. But, before I could do that, I had to make the Arduino and ESP8266 connect to my WiFi. I configured the ESP8266 by wiring it with a breadboard to the Arduino and writing code in Arduino IDE. Once I successfully made my circuit and connected it to the same WiFi as Blynk, I was able to connect it to Blynk and finish my first milestone.

# Schematics 
<!--- Here's where you'll put images of your schematics. [Tinkercad](https://www.tinkercad.com/blog/official-guide-to-tinkercad-circuits) and [Fritzing](https://fritzing.org/learning/) are both great resources to create professional schematic diagrams, though BSE recommends Tinkercad because it can be done easily and for free in the browser. -->

# Code

```c++
#include <SoftwareSerial.h>
SoftwareSerial espSerial(2, 3); //Rx,Tx

// Template ID, Device Name and Auth Token are provided by the Blynk.Cloud (mine are private)
// See the Device Info tab, or Template settings
#define BLYNK_TEMPLATE_ID "*****"
#define BLYNK_TEMPLATE_NAME "*****"
#define BLYNK_AUTH_TOKEN "*****"

#define BLYNK_PRINT Serial

#include <ESP8266_Lib.h>
#include <BlynkSimpleShieldEsp8266.h>

char auth[] = BLYNK_AUTH_TOKEN;

// WiFi credentials (mine are private)
char ssid[] = "*****";
char pass[] = "*****";

#include <SoftwareSerial.h>
SoftwareSerial EspSerial(2, 3); // RX, TX

#define ESP8266_BAUD 9600

ESP8266 wifi(&EspSerial);

void setup()
{
  Serial.begin(115200);

  EspSerial.begin(ESP8266_BAUD);
  delay(10);

  Blynk.begin(auth, wifi, ssid, pass);
}

void loop()
{
  Blynk.run();
}
```

# Bill of Materials
<!--- Here's where you'll list the parts in your project. To add more rows, just copy and paste the example rows below.
Don't forget to place the link of where to buy each component inside the quotation marks in the corresponding row after href =. Follow the guide [here]([url](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/)) to learn how to customize this to your project needs. -->

<!--- # Other Resources/Examples
One of the best parts about Github is that you can view how other people set up their own work. Here are some past BSE portfolios that are awesome examples. You can view how they set up their portfolio, and you can view their index.md files to understand how they implemented different portfolio components.
- [Example 1](https://trashytuber.github.io/YimingJiaBlueStamp/)
- [Example 2](https://sviatil0.github.io/Sviatoslav_BSE/)
- [Example 3](https://arneshkumar.github.io/arneshbluestamp/)
